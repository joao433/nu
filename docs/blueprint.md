# **App Name**: NuCred Landing

## Core Features:

- Header Component: Display 'nu' logo, a 'Quero ser Nubank' button, and a minimal menu bar with 'hamburger,' 'search,' and 'user' icons in the header.
- Hero Section: Show a main title with 'Nubank' in purple, 'Empr√©stimos' in large black text, and 'Transparentes, seguros e do seu jeito' in smaller black text as a subtitle.
- Illustrative Image: Include an image of a couple looking at paperwork with a laptop on a table, contained within a rounded card.
- CPF Input Form: Provide a simple form to collect the user's CPF with a 'Digite seu CPF' placeholder.
- Form Submission Mockup: Simulate action with basic validation on the 'Continuar' button to acknowledge CPF input. The alert just tells the user the CPF was submitted.
- Responsive Design: Ensure full responsiveness for mobile and desktop devices, converting the menu to a hamburger icon on smaller screens and using a single-column layout for mobile.
